# serene, an unopinionated front-end for torrent daemons

[![js-standard-style](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](http://standardjs.com/)

Provides a modular and extensible front-end for torrent daemons that can be used across devices and platforms.

**There's not much to see here at the moment. When in a usable state, this addendum will be removed from the README.**

## on modularity

Serene is in a extreme-mega-ultra-not-usable state, so logic for communicating with rTorrent will be in here. This section will be removed once decoupling has occurred.
